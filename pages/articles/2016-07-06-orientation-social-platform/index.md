###  Orientation Social Platform
Summer 2015. All of my classmates have to do a two month worker internship.
Because I had already done mine in my first year at [ESSTIN](https://www.esstin.univ-lorraine.fr/),
I had to find out what to do in my 3 months holidays. Back in time, I was in charge of the
orientation team at my school and we decided to offer to the new students something never done before :
an entire platform whose purpose was to help every student to know each other.
